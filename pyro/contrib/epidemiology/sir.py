class OverdispersedSIRModel(CompartmentalModel):
    """
    Overdispersed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model.

    To customize this model we recommend forking and editing this class.

    This is a stochastic discrete-time discrete-state model with three
    compartments: "S" for susceptible, "I" for infected, and "R" for
    recovered individuals (the recovered individuals are implicit: ``R =
    population - S - I``) with transitions ``S -> I -> R``.

    This model accounts for superspreading (overdispersed individual
    reproductive number) by assuming each infected individual infects
    BetaBinomial-many susceptible individuals, where the BetaBinomial
    distribution acts as an overdispersed Binomial distribution, adapting the
    more standard NegativeBinomial distribution that acts as an overdispersed
    Poisson distribution [1,2] to the setting of finite populations. To
    preserve Markov structure, we follow [2] and assume all infections by a
    single individual occur on the single time step where that individual makes
    an ``I -> R`` transition. That is, whereas the :class:`SimpleSIRModel`
    assumes infected individuals infect `Binomial(S,R/tau)`-many susceptible
    individuals during each infected time step (over `tau`-many steps on
    average), this model assumes they infect `BetaBinomial(k,...,S)`-many
    susceptible individuals but only on the final time step before recovering.
