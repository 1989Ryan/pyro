Epidemiological Models
======================
.. automodule:: pyro.contrib.outbreak

``pyro.contrib.outbreak`` is a lightweight framework for experimenting with a
restricted class of stochastic discrete-time discrete-count compartmental
models. This framework implements inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,
prediction of latent variables, and forecasting future trends.

For explanation of the underlying machinery in this framework, see the
`SIR with HMC tutorial <http://pyro.ai/examples/sir_hcm.html>`_
